# Who am I?

My Name is Arooran Sivakarunai, a CS student at Toronto Metropolitan University. I'm an avid student of the latest Machine Learning and Cyber Security trends, and hope to go into any of those fields once I graduate. I have a couple of hobbies, such as reading mystery novels, playing video games, and learning to cook new recipes! With this website, I want to use it as a medium to share my ideas with the world. Whether that be through blog posts or people looking at my CV, I want people to gain a better understanding of who I am through this site.
